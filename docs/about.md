# About Me

<div class="subhead">
I'm a brand and product strategist who found his way to technical SEO through the messiest possible route — scaling a jam brand from Iceland into the US market, co-founding a SaaS platform, and playing professional soccer across three countries. Every step taught me something about systems, growth, and what actually moves the needle.

## The short version

I'm Jordian Farahani — originally from Regina, Canada. I spent the last 6 years building brands internationally: scaling DTC channels for GOOD GOOD Brand in Reykjavik (the 2,433% organic growth story), co-founding an AI-powered B2B commerce platform, managing full-funnel marketing ranging from local SMBs to influence marketing consultancy in London.

Along the way, I kept gravitating toward the same thing: **the technical layer underneath marketing**. Crawl budgets, schema markup, site architecture, Core Web Vitals, AI search visibility. The part most marketers skip over is the part I find most interesting.

Now I'm back at home in Canada, focused on technical SEO and AI search visibility. I am available for a start date ASAP.

## How I work

I approach SEO as an engineering discipline, not a checklist. Every recommendation ties back to observable evidence — crawl data, structured data validation, performance metrics, or live AI search results.

**Operating principles:**
- **Evidence over opinion.** Every finding includes the data that supports it. If I can't show you the crawl output or the schema test, I don't make the claim.
- **Prioritize by impact.** Not everything broken is worth fixing first. A missing favicon is not the same as 874 blog posts with agency authorship on a YMYL site.
- **Automate the repetitive.** I use Claude Code, custom scripts, and tools like Screaming Frog to handle the grunt work so I can focus on the analysis and strategy.

## What I bring to the table

<div class="about-grid">

<div class="about-card">
<h4>Technical SEO depth</h4>

Crawlability, indexation, canonicals, redirect chains, log file analysis, heading structure, internal linking architecture. I audit with Screaming Frog, Ahrefs/SEMrush, and Chrome DevTools — not just surface-level checkers.

</div>

<div class="about-card">
<h4>AI search visibility (GEO)</h4>

I test how brands actually appear in Google AI Mode, ChatGPT, and Perplexity. Crawler access auditing, llms.txt implementation, passage-level citability, structured data for AI extraction. This is where search is going.

</div>

<div class="about-card">
<h4>Product & brand strategy</h4>

7+ years of P&L ownership, go-to-market execution, and product positioning. I understand the business side — CAC, LTV, conversion funnels — not just the search side. I've written PRDs, managed NPD pipelines, and directed packaging redesigns.

</div>

<div class="about-card">
<h4>Cross-functional fluency</h4>

I've worked with developers (MACH architecture, headless CMS, WebSocket APIs), designers (brand books, packaging), sales teams (distinctive brand assets), and C-suite (P&L reporting). I translate between technical and commercial.

## The longer story

I studied Political Science and Sociology at the University of Saskatchewan, then played professional soccer — Vancouver Whitecaps, Ottawa Fury, and IR Reykjavik. That path took me to Iceland, where I completed a Master's in Business (Marketing) at Reykjavik University with First Class honours.

While in Iceland, I joined **GOOD GOOD Brand** as Senior Brand & Digital Marketing Manager. That's where the growth story happened: I led the US-First pivot that turned a niche Icelandic jam company into the fastest-growing jam brand in the US market by late 2022. Organic traffic went from 1,500 to 38,300 monthly visitors. I owned the DTC P&L across Shopify, Amazon, and Instacart — break-even in 2 years.

After GOOD GOOD, I co-founded **Buyience** through Epic Web Techno — an AI-powered B2B commerce platform built on MACH principles. I led product strategy, wrote PRDs for features like real-time AI negotiation engines, and ran SEO and UX audits for agency clients.

Throughout all of it, I coached soccer on the side — 15+ years of mentoring youth athletes, including co-owning a high-performance academy. The discipline and team leadership from professional sport carries into everything I do.

## What I care about

- **Technical foundations** — crawlability, indexation, canonical hygiene, redirect chains, schema validation
- **Content trust** — E-E-A-T signals, author credibility, YMYL compliance, medical review workflows
- **AI readiness** — structured data for extraction, llms.txt, citation-worthy content, GEO scoring
- **Performance** — Core Web Vitals, JS bloat, real user metrics vs. lab scores, the lab-field gap
- **Clean systems** — automation, reproducible audits, documentation that ships
