## How I work

I approach SEO as an engineering discipline, not a checklist. Every recommendation ties back to observable evidence — crawl data, structured data validation, performance metrics, or live AI search results.

**Operating principles:**
- **Evidence over opinion.** Every finding includes the data that supports it.
- **Prioritize by impact.** Not everything broken is worth fixing first.
- **Ship clean documentation.** Audits should be readable by devs, marketers, and leadership.

## What I care about

- **Technical foundations** — crawlability, indexation, canonical hygiene, redirect chains
- **Content trust** — E-E-A-T signals, author credibility, YMYL compliance
- **AI readiness** — structured data for extraction, llms.txt, citation-worthy content
- **Performance** — Core Web Vitals, JS bloat, real user metrics vs. lab scores
