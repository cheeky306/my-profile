## GOOD GOOD Brand — 2,433% Organic Growth

### Context
<div class="meta-line"><span>Industry:</span> DTC Food & Beverage (Jam, Spreads, Sweeteners) · <span>Platform:</span> Shopify · <span>Timeline:</span> Jan 2022 – Mar 2024 (effects compounding through 2025)</div>

GOOD GOOD is an Icelandic better-for-you jam and sweetener brand. When I joined as Sr. Manager, Brand & Digital Strategy in January 2022, the brand had a small domestic following but near-zero US organic search presence. My mandate was to lead the "US-First" pivot across brand, DTC, and digital — including building the SEO engine from scratch.

### Problem
- **Zero organic foundation.** In May 2021, GOOD GOOD ranked for 0 unbranded keywords with 0 organic traffic.
- **No US search presence.** The brand was Icelandic-first with no content strategy targeting the US market.
- **DTC channels not profitable.** Shopify, Amazon, and Instacart channels were burning cash with no path to break-even.
- **Brand awareness gap.** Branded search volume was minimal (159 monthly visitors, May 2022) — people didn't know GOOD GOOD existed.

### Actions taken

1. **Built the SEO content engine from zero.** Created the blog and content architecture targeting high-volume unbranded keywords in the jam, spreads, and sugar-substitute space. Went from 0 to 26 ranking keywords in the first 5 months, then scaled aggressively.

2. **Executed the US-First brand pivot.** Repositioned GOOD GOOD from a niche Icelandic brand to a US-market-first DTC brand — new messaging, new packaging (directed a full redesign rooted in mixed-methods consumer research), new visual identity.

3. **Owned the full DTC P&L.** Managed Shopify, Amazon, Instacart, and Social channels end-to-end. Achieved break-even within 2 years.

4. **Invested in high-value content.** Partnered with an SEO agency in the final 6–9 months to scale content production targeting competitive unbranded terms (marmalade, fig jam, best sugar substitute, healthiest sweetener for coffee).

5. **Established NPD pipeline.** Built the internal New Product Development process using consumer data — launched products like Vegan Lemon Curd that generated both search interest and retail demand.

6. **CRM and site infrastructure.** Led HubSpot CRM implementation and full website redesign to support the growth.

### Outcomes — organic traffic

| Period | Organic traffic (monthly) | Change |
|--------|-------------------------:|-------:|
| Jul 2022 (baseline after 6 months) | 1,700 | — |
| Jul 2023 | 4,400 | +159% |
| Jul 2024 | 33,800 | +**1,888%** from baseline |
| Current (2025) | 40,100 | +**2,259%** from baseline |

### Outcomes — keyword rankings (unbranded)

| Period | Keywords ranking | Organic traffic | YoY growth |
|--------|----------------:|----------------:|-----------:|
| May 2021 | 0 | 0 | — |
| May 2022 | 26 | 150 | — |
| May 2023 | 3,023 | 3,800 | +2,433% |
| May 2024 | 9,158 | 38,300 | +908% |
| May 2025 | 14,109 | 40,100 | +5% |

<div class="cs-callout-number">14,109</div>
<div class="cs-callout-label">unbranded keywords ranking — up from zero in May 2021</div>
</div>

### Outcomes — branded search

| Period | Branded visitors (monthly) |
|--------|---------------------------:|
| May 2022 | 159 |
| May 2025 | 4,900 |
| **Growth** | **+2,981%** |

Branded search growth reflects the compounding effect of the US-First pivot: packaging redesign, DTC scale-up, content engine, and retail distribution all feeding brand awareness.

### Outcomes — Google Search Console

| Period | Monthly clicks from Google |
|--------|---------------------------:|
| Jan 2024 | 6,740 |
| Jan 2025 | 21,800 |
| **Growth** | **+223%** |

### Outcomes — compounding growth rates

| Period | YoY organic traffic growth |
|--------|---------------------------:|
| 2022 → 2023 | +11,527% |
| 2023 → 2024 | +203% |
| 2024 → 2025 | +54% |

Growth is compounding but showing natural diminishing returns — the engine I built continues to perform, but without continued investment the gains will plateau.

### Notable ranking wins

</div>

</div>

### What this proves

- **SEO compounds.** The work I did in 2022–2024 continues generating 40K+ monthly visits a year after I left. That's the power of building a real content engine vs. running paid campaigns.
- **Brand + SEO is a flywheel.** The US-First pivot drove brand awareness, which drove branded search, which drove domain authority, which drove unbranded rankings. Each reinforced the other.
- **Investment matters.** The 11,527% first-year spike came from building the foundation. The continued 200%+ growth came from investing in the last 6–9 months of SEO content. The slowdown to 54% tracks exactly with reduced investment after my departure.
